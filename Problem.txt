Add a remove method to the AVL tree class of this chapter. Use a graphical user interface that allows a user to work interactively with the AVL tree, adding and removing items as desired.

Implement the remove() method which starts on line 106 of the Main.java file. Pay attention to the comments.

Note: You may want to full screen the GUI window for testing. You will need to use the add element command to add values to the tree for testing. Example

add 1
Will add the integer 1 to the tree

add 5
will add the integer 5 to the tree
